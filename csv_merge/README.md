csv_merge.py
============

This is a simple script to help me merge two sets of related flashcards--one
contains JLPT vocabulary and English translations, the other contains JLPT
vocabulary that contain kanji and its hiragana pronunciation.

I want a single set of flashcards that shows the word on one side and its
pronunciation and English meaning on the other by exporting them to CSV,
merging them with this script, then importing the new CSV file into Anki.

I'm also using this opportunity to try using Python and Git in Visual Studio.
